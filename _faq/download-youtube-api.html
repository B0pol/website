title: "Does NewPipe use the NewPipe API?"
---
<section>
    <p>No. NewPipe does not rely on the YouTube API. Using it requires an API key and binds us to specific regulations and restrictions, e.g. YouTube would have much more options to <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service#api-clients-and-monitoring">track your YouTube usage</a>.
        Therefore, <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor/">NewPipe Extractor</a> gets the information by parsing YouTube websites.</p>
