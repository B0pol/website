title: "Download to SD card fails"
---
<section>
    <p class="text-info">We are aware of a bug that causes a crash when downloading a stream to an external SD card.
        We are sorry for this inconvenience and trying our best to fix this issue. </p>
    <p> Due to an outdated library (Gigaget) we are planing to refactor the whole download handling.
        This might take a while. We've raised a bounty for implementing certain aspects of the new mechanism.
        You can take a look at the corresponding ticket on
        <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/962">GitHub</a>.</p>
