Hey there! Guess who is back? We. We are. Admittedly, we're quite a bit late with this one. But there is a _very_ good reason for that. Are you ready for it? Sit down, grab some popcorn and a beverage of your choice. This is going to be long.

## A new unified player

"What in the name of the coronavirus is the _unified player_?" you ask. Well, first of all, that's a very weird expression. Where did you even get that one from... - you know what? Nah. We don't want to know. You just keep on using that, we keep on talking about the new player.

A new player it indeed is. Up until now, NewPipe had three different players bundled in its code: the main, pop-up and background player. All three had separate code and separate playing queues. When you switched from one player to another, the stream would start from the beginning instead of carrying on from where you left. In the background, the old player and its queue closed itself, while the new one took over. If that sounds complicated and cumbersome, it does because it is. At least if you ask us.

Well, no more! Now, when you switch from one player to another, you resume _exactly_ where you left off, and even your playing queue carries over! Since there is only one player (although with all of the three different playing modes), there is only one queue as well. Ah, serendipity.

This was made possible by rewriting the code so that all players run on one common service. When you switch from one player to another, this service remains running, preserving the stream data, and the new player just picks up from where the old one left off.

### Video detail page

A more unified experience is not the only feature this change brought you. There is one which is immediately noticeable once you open a video in the new version: The video details page. Earlier, when you opened the video details, you were shown a thumbnail, video description, comments, etc., and tapping the thumbnail would open the player in full-screen, hiding the rest of these informations. Now, when you're in portrait mode, the video plays right in the video details page - just like YouTube! There is even a new autoplay setting which plays the video automatically when you open video details - also just like YouTube! This setting will be turned on by default. Of course, you can turn it off if you prefer the behaviour of the previous versions.

### Video orientation

Previously, playing a video with the main video player would always result in it being in full-screen regardless of your selected orientation. This was fine for landscape videos in landscape and portrait videos in portrait mode, but it resulted in a lot of wasted space if the video's orientation didn't match the player's. No more! There is now a full-screen button which replaces the orientation switch button, and it is _smart_. It will detect if the video is landscape or portrait, and will ensure the player is in the correct orientation when you enter full-screen! How's _that_ for convenience and usability? Not only that, but if auto-rotate is enabled, and the video is a landscape one, the button will disappear because you don't need it! (In portrait mode, you still need the button to go into full-screen from the video details.)

### Swiping down

You can now swipe down on the video in the video details page to _minimize_ it - just like Youtu... wait no. It's better. You get a minimized player at the bottom, and you can play/pause or even close it from there. How cool is that? The video will keep playing (or stay paused, if you prefer that) while you can browse NewPipe at your leisure! No more having to finish a video before browsing mindlessly! Yay distractions! (In landscape mode, you can swipe down on the title to minimize as well. The swipe area is confined to that region because the rest is used for the existing volume and brightness gestures, as you know.)

Since the player can now be minimized instead of closed, this means you get to retain your opened video queue! Let us go through an example: You watch a video, minimize it, then browse the trending page (you insane person), watch a video from there, quickly minimize it, browse for some calming music, and finally watch a video about pandas. As long as the minimized player isn't closed (by using the cross button or swiping down on it), you can tap back to go through those videos in reverse order! This allows you to browse a whole bunch of videos and quickly build up a video queue before you start watching them. You were able do this earlier, but you had to use the background or popup player queues as a workaround, since the main players queue wasn't accessible previously.

### Thumbnail progress bar

You can only see this when you play the video in the background or pop-up, but there is now a shiny new progress bar underneath the thumbnail! It updates in real time, gets a lit tle counter and a red bar - its great, really.  

All of what you've read above was made possible by the lean and mean coding machine, the one and only - (drumroll) - [@avently](https://github.com/avently)! Seriously, you should all sacrifice your first born child in his name. Or just say thank you, whatever works out for ya.

On a serious note, this was a massive, massive change to not only the code, but also the apps workflow, and so this PR was tested, reviewed and modified lots of times, over a long period of time, before it was allowed to saw the light of day with this release. A huge thank you to you, [@avently](https://github.com/avently), for having the patience and dedication to keep adding features and bug fixes until everyone was satisfied! A different person probably would have gone insane. And a big thank you to the maintainers for doggedly reviewing this gigantic PR repeatedly, those ~6600 additions and ~5600 removals must have felt intimidating!

Naturally, since this was such a massive change, several bugs also slipped through. But [@avently](https://github.com/avently), with the help of [@blackbox87](https://github.com/blackbox87), [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox), [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr), (add more as they come), fixed them rapidly as they were reported. 

## The Notification is dead, long live the Notification!

If you care about such things, you have likely noticed that NewPipe's notification looks quite different from most media player apps these days. It has a progress bar, buttons in odd places, and a permanent grey colour. This is because NewPipe uses an old API for notifications called RemoteView. This allowed for a lot of customisation, and that was good at the time it was in vogue. However, it has been deprecated and superseded by a more modern API.

Enter the **Mediastyle notification age**:

This is a special notification type which has been available for media apps to use since Android Lollipop. In Oreo, it gained the ability to be coloured to match the colour theme of the cover art of the music playing. And since Android 10, it has a seekbar built right into it! It is a powerful API that removes the need to use a whole bunch of custom code to achieve what we had so far. This will make it far easier to maintain and improve NewPipes notification. Win for development!

### Android 9

So let's get on with what is new and what has changed. First of all, sorry users on Android 9 and below. The progress bar is gone. As we've said above, it will only be shown on Android 10. We're a small team and can't maintain code for the old and new type of notifications simultaneously, so the old one has to go. And not just that; the old notification isn't even supported Android 11 onwards. Bye-bye RemoteView notifications. We shall miss you! :'(

But you get a lot in exchange for that sacrifice!

### New features

You get five CUSTOMISABLE - you read it right! - **CUSTOMISABLE** action buttons to control playback. There is a new notification menu in the apps settings, and you can choose which button should carry which player action. Play/pause, forward/rewind, previous/next, shuffle, repeat, close, or even nothing!

Then, you can choose which three of these five buttons show in the compact notification (remember that little arrow you use to expand/reduce the notification?).

For users on **Android 8+**: Colours! Warm colours. Cool colours. All the colours! As we've noted above, Mediastyle notifications adapt to the colours of the cover art, which looks just plain awesome.

For users on **Android 10+**: Seekbar! The old notification had a progress bar, but that was just a visual indicator. Now you can actually seek from the notification itself. Congratulations! Have fun seeking.

For users on **Android 11**: Congratulations. You get a notification now! NewPipe's media session will show up in the notification shade and in Quick Settings just as advertised. There are still some bugs because we had to rush after 11 was released, but they'll be fixed pretty soon.

This cool contribution was brought to us in its original form by [@cool-student](https://github.com/cool-student). Sadly, we couldn't get in touch with them when we were ready to focus on this PR, so [@wb9688](https://github.com/wb9688) and [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) swooped in to save the day! [@wb9688](https://github.com/wb9688) updated the code to conform to our standards and coding style, and [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) did the (painstaking!) work of rebasing the code after the unified player PR was merged into the development branch.

Ultimately, he took over the responsibility for this PR. He updated and polished the UI, fixed bugs, got everyone and their grandfather to test the changes, and pulled us to the finish line!
