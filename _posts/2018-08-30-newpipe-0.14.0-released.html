<p>It has been a while since the last post was published, but here we are, back with great news:</p>

<p>We proudly announce NewPipe version 0.14.0 which comes with a more customizable main page,
    a better navigation menu and several player improvements.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p><a href="https://github.com/Somethingweirdhere">@Somethingweirdhere</a> invested time to polish NewPipe's UI.
    We all thank him for his effort. Due to the new look and the even more customizable main page,
    we think a short summarize of the changes in NewPipe 0.14.0 might be helpful to these
    who want to try them out immediately.</p>

<h3 id="betternavigationmenu">Better Navigation Menu</h3>

<p>The first improvement brings more material touch to NewPipe.
    <a href="https://github.com/Somethingweirdhere">@Somethingweirdhere</a> removed the options menu in the action bar
    and added its content to the navigation menu. From now on it is only possible to access the settings
    and download page via the navigation menu. You can open it by clicking on the burger menu icon on the top left
    or swiping from the left side of the screen to the right.</p>

<p>You will notice a new element structure in the navigation menu.
    For the reason that NewPipe aims to support multiple services, only the respective sub-pages are visible
    and all services are hidden. So-called "kiosks" such as "Trending" in the case of YouTube or "Top 50" in SoundCloud
    change here depending on the active service. To change to another service,
    tap on the small triangle in the lower right corner of the NewPipe banner. You can now see all available services.
    By default, YouTube is enabled. To activate SoundCloud instead, tap on it. You will notice a different color scheme and
    when opening the navigation menu, you will find the "Top 50" and "New and Hot" kiosks.</p>

<h3 id="moreflexibilityonthemainpage">More flexibility on the main page</h3>

<p>With version 0.14.0 it is now possible to add and remove several tabs from your main page.
    To do so, open the settings via the navigation drawer. In difference to earlier versions,
    the content management of the main page is now placed in the category "Appearance".
    The specific setting is still called "Content of main page". Tap on it to manage the different tabs.</p>

<p>You can reorder the tabs via drag'n drop and remove a tab by swiping it to left or right side of the screen.
    To add a new tab, use the "+" button at the right bottom. You can now choose between several possibilities.
    Your changes will be saved automatically and applied instantly.</p>

<h3 id="alsochangedinthisversion">Also changed in this version</h3>

<p>As explained in the <a href="https://newpipe.schabi.org/FAQ/download/">FAQ</a>, NewPipe does not support downloads
    to external SDCards yet. To increase the user experience and prevent the app from crashing,
    users are now warned when selecting a directory on an external SDCard.</p>

<p>A better way to close NewPipe's popup window got requested by multiple people.
    <a href="https://github.com/mauriciocolli">@mauriciocolli</a> implemented a red closing button to help out.
    When moving the popup window, this button appears at the bottom of the display. To close the popup,
    just drag it onto the button.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TheMatten">@TheMatten</a> improved the player's UI when changing volume and brightness.</p>

<p>This new version also provides various fixes. <a href="https://github.com/theScrabi">@theScrabi</a> made the search results work
    properly again. Before, only the first two pages were loaded and then repeated.</p>

<p>Furthermore YouTube Premium videos are blocked correctly now and some videos which did not load
    due to invalid DASH parsing, should now load as expected. A bug which prevented video thumbnails to not show up on the
    notification on Android 8.1 has also been fixed. Additionally more links in the video description work correctly now.</p>

<p>To provide no false information, incorrect explanations of M4A and WebM audio formats have been
    removed from all translations. At this point we would like to thank the numerous translators which updated and improved
    translations for this release.</p>
