Thanks to the efforts of [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr), we are proud to
announce that our blog does now have feeds ready for subscription!

We implemented both Atom and RSS feeds for maximum compatibility. You should
be able to use either feed type with any feed reader application.

Please use the following URLs:

  - Atom: [https://newpipe.schabi.org/blog/feeds/news.atom](https://newpipe.schabi.org/blog/feeds/news.atom)
  - RSS: [https://newpipe.schabi.org/blog/feeds/news.rss](https://newpipe.schabi.org/blog/feeds/news.rss)

You can also use [https://newpipe.org/blog/](https://newpipe.schabi.org/blog/)
directly to have your reader choose the right URL for you.

Let us know about issues in the comments!
