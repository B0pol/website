We have just released NewPipe 0.14.2. Such as NewPipe 0.14.0 this version mostly brings UI and UX improvements.
This includes new layouts for tablets and large devices and an additional linear layout in "Downloads".

Furthermore, the subscriptions page got a small upgrade, several bugs were fixed and new translations added.

## New tablet UI

[@nv95](https://github.com/nv95) brings a completely new feeling to NewPipe on tablets: he implemented grid layouts for video lists like the search, a channel's videos or trending.

On top of that, he also made the video detail view responsive. This means, next and recommended videos will be displayed at the right side of your screen if your device is large enough.

[@somebodyelse](https://github.com/) implemented an additional list layout for the Downloads. This might help with these videos which titles have the same beginnings.

This version brings also interesting changes to the subscription page. [@somethingwieredhere](https://github.com/somethingweiredhere) added a new longpress menu to it. From within the menu you can share and delete a subscription. This is helpful whenever a channel was deleted or renamed by YouTube. So if you have had dead channels before, it is now time to clean them up!
And for those, who have discovered incorrect subscription counts in the past, this will not happen again - hopefully.

## Further changes

As said above this release brings a bunch of small UI and UX improvements.
