Merry Christmas, if you celebrate that, and almost Happy New Year, if you use a calendar at least close to the Gregorian one. We want to present you a little gift as a good way to start into 2021 AD: The next release of NewPipe. It comes with a lot of improvements, fixes, and even a big new feature. So let us dive into this release post!

## New in this version
YouTube mixes are a feature now, and they are dropping in hot (and with a lot of bass). Opening a mix in previous versions resulted in the first video of the mix playing, nothing else. Now you see the full playlist and even a nice radio icon as an indicator. Enjoy listening to never-ending lists and thank [@XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin) for this feature as well as [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) for reviewing it.

This release includes support for another feature from YouTube: meta info. The little boxes sometimes telling you that a channel belongs to a news group, or giving you further information to specific search queries - they appear in NewPipe now as well. If you do not want to see those boxes, head over to <code><nobr><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/icons/baseline-settings-20px.svg" /> Settings</nobr> > <nobr><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/icons/baseline-language-20px.svg" /> Content</nobr> > <nobr>Show meta info</nobr></code> and disable the display there. If you enjoy these boxes however, thank [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) for bringing them into this release.

In some kind of more personal news, we have a new domain now - [https://newpipe.net](https://newpipe.net). This makes us look more professional (we hope), but also meant the URLs needed to be updated in the app. This was done by [@TiA4f8R](https://github.com/TiA4f8R).
## Bugs, be gone!
We aim for the best NewPipe with every release we do. Because of that, we improve on issues in every update. This time around, we fixed an issue where the app would crash when you tried to delete a video from your playlist while the app was refreshing your subscriptions. This was discovered by [@gasull](https://github.com/gasull), reproduced by [@chilliger](https://github.com/chilliger) and fixed by [@hlloreda](https://github.com/hlloreda). Thanks to all three of them. 

In another attempt to improve the ReCaptcha experience, [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) fixed a situation where only a blank page was shown. They also prevented device information to be leaked inside the user agent used for the recaptcha service and are likely very exhausted with that topic at this point. We thank them massively for taking up this issue time and time again.

Talking about time, sharing URLs from any service except YouTube now doesn't try to add a timestamp to the URL of the video. This broke the URL on any other service. In the future we hope to support the timestamps of every platform, for now, you get non-timed URLs that work. This was provided by [@B0pol](https://github.com/B0pol), thank you!

The last big fix is brought to you by [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr), who got YouTube's music search to work once again. Search all the music that you want now (with the filters next to the search bar) and enjoy listing to Christmas songs you can not get out of your head.

## Nerd talk

There were quite some very technical/non-user-facing changes in this release. We decided to provide you this nice list with changes not affecting you at all, but we still want to publicly thank their creators:
- The Invidious (alternative YouTube frontend which the extractor uses to access YouTube) URL list in the manifest was updated by [@opusforlife2](https://github.com/opusforlife2)
- Switching our CI tests from Travis to GitHub by [@FireMasterK](https://github.com/FireMasterK)
- Some internal variables and comments had typos, and [@mhmdanas](https://github.com/mhmdanas) fixed them
- We use `ContextCompat.getDataDir()`, `ServiceCompat.stopForeground()` and `ActivityCompat.recreate()` because [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) decided that is good and everyone agreed, also because older Android version can access this feature
- NewPipe changed how the progess bar in the notification is displayed (not using ProgressDialog in MissionAdapter anymore because that is depreciated), also because [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) changed code
- The database export logic got its own class and now we can create unit tests for it, made by [@XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin)
- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) is on fire this release, they also changed Kotlin synthetics to view bindings because of depreciation
- The NewPipe extractor supports stream segments for YouTube now, and this release does, and all this because of [@vkay94](https://github.com/vkay94)
- It also works with Peertubes stream URLs now when they don't have tags, because [@B0pol](https://github.com/B0pol) did some code.
- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) made one last appearance in this release, because they added Object methods to the extractor.

## Where to get this brand-new version

NewPipe notifies you about new versions. You can download them when you press the notification, which will take you to the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases).

If you use the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it, too, notifies you about updates for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/). Please keep in mind that it can take F-Droid a while to update their repository. If you have problems installing you may need to uninstall NewPipe and then install it afresh. (Make sure to backup data by exporting your database from the Content settings menu.)

If you already installed NewPipe from F-Droid's repository, to get this version of NewPipe you can do one of the following:
- Wait for them to update (_there seem to be problems with that lately, so better_)
- Switch to NewPipe's custom repository by following the [directions in the announcement post]({% post_url 2020-05-30-f-droid-repo %})

Note: If you installed NewPipe from GitHub Releases you will not have to uninstall NewPipe to switch to our custom repo. Just let it update your current version.

Now that you've updated, please let us know what your experience of the latest release is, especially bugs in need of fixing. As usual, you can reach out to us via IRC ([#newpipe on freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=newpipe)), [open issues on GitHub](TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/new) or, ideally, use our built-in crash reporter to send us machine-readable issue reports. You can even [send in fixes](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) yourself.

If you have any other questions feel free to send them in the comments here and someone will reply to you.
