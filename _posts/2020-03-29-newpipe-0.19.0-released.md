A new day, a new full release. In today's update, NewPipe is proudly bringing you a great way to sort your subscriptions and a mute button, on top of the usual smaller improvements and fixes<!-- more -->


## Folders

Since moving images say more than my words, please have a look at them:

<video src="/img/folders.mp4" class="no-flow img-responsive" width="220" height="140" autoplay loop></video>

For those who prefer to read, this is for you: NewPipe now supports grouping subscriptions into folders. All the recent videos of those channels then appear in one re-loadable feed when you press on the folder. While [@mauriciocolli](https://github.com/mauriciocolli) implemented that, he also improved the `What's New` sidebar feed. And on top of that, live streams have now a viewer count in those feeds!


## Mute button

This release doesn't stop at folders though. Thanks to [@karkaminski](https://github.com/karkaminski), NewPipe now has mute button. [@B0pol](https://github.com/B0pol) formed it further into the shape you can experience it in now. _"But where can I find it"_ you ask. Fear not, for I have prepared a gallery of screenshots. To access the pop-up and background player menus shown, you need to press on the notification from NewPipe.

<img class="no-flow vertical" src="/img/screenshots/mute_main.jpg"/>
<div class="media-row media-items-2">
<img class="no-flow img-responsive" src="/img/screenshots/mute_pop.jpg"/>
<img class="no-flow img-responsive" src="/img/screenshots/mute_back.jpg"/>
</div>


## Smaller Improvements

[@comradekingu](https://github.com/comradekingu) took care of the English base strings in this release and made sure they are consistent. Further improving the user experience was also [@XiangRongLins](https://github.com/XiangRongLin) goal, he made sure that the seek duration jumped visibly to an even one when the fast inexact search option gets activated. Previously the user wouldn't see this directly, but experience when seeking for- or backwards. Thanks to [@opusforlife2](https://github.com/opusforlife2), two settings moved from `Appearance` to `Content`, where they belonged all along: `Show 'Next'` and `Content of main page`.

[@wb9688](https://github.com/wb9688) and [@B0pol](https://github.com/B0pol) (in his second contribution) added support for more subdomains. Now `music.youtube.com` and `media.ccc.de` are natively supported by NewPipe, thanks you two. In the last point to this section, [@jonas-skywalker](https://github.com/jonas-skywalker) (may the force be with you) improved the search section. Now the magnifying glass vanishes once you start typing.

## Fixes a.k.a. NewPipe crashes less \o/

Android 9 changed how databases behave, effectively destroying backups and exporting remote playlists - not anymore, thanks to [@yausername](https://github.com/yausername). [@XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin) improved sharing a downloaded video to other apps, which crashed the app before this release. The app also crashed when you tried to download a really large video, which [@XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin) fixed in his third contribution. The seek duration setting was not properly shown in any other language then English, but [@B0pol](https://github.com/B0pol) let them magically appear again. And finally, [@kapodamy](https://github.com/kapodamy) took care of a nasty bugs, which made some WebM videos non seekable. Now you can seek all you want.

All of the following fixes were done by the incredible [@mauriciocolli](https://github.com/mauriciocolli). Overall, he brought seven (!) different contributions in todays release. He solved an issue where the last screen of the app could be popping up during the app exit animation. A bug in the main screen resulted to tabs not being restored correctly if the app was put to sleep by Android. The main screen had another issue, especially with the menu, which could vanish until the user interacted with the app again. Sharing a YouTube link to NewPipe could end up crashing NewPipe if certain characters were in those links, not an issue anymore. And finally, he improved the handling of unavailable content on YouTube, which resulted in a crash previously.

## Development

This release also includes two big improvements of the development process. [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) and [@mauriciocolli](https://github.com/mauriciocolli) changed the way `.apk` files are generated in the development process. This makes it way easier to test a change on your device, since you can have all of these NewPipe apps alongside each other, as long as you have the storage for them.

[@Poolitzer](https://github.com/poolitzer), who already took over the latest blog posts, now created up-to-date issue templates, which makes it easier for you to report a bug or suggest a feature. The final form of them that you are experiencing is the result of a combined effort of the whole community, thanks for everyone who forced me to implement and discuss their suggestions.


## Conclusion

That’s it for this release. A big thanks goes out to all the people who made this possible, especially those not mentioned: Developers for helping out fellow developers, testers for testing, maintainers for maintaining, users like you for reporting the bugs in the first place. If you'd like to get a more technical view into the app, you can find the release page [here](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases/tag/v0.19.0) and the corresponding PR [here](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/3267).

Today, I want to especially point out our [IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=newpipe). Feel free to join our welcoming community in these trying times. Just to chat with all of us, discuss NewPipe, uptimes of servers, Ubuntu derivation or apparently floppy disks. It is free, easy and fun (I promise).
