With the aim of making NewPipe bug free and achieving a stable 1.0.0 release,
we are pleased to announce the immediate availability of NewPipe Beta.

<!-- more -->

The beta app can be downloaded and installed via [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe.beta/) as a separate app.
It includes not only new features such as local playlist and SoundCloud support but also an interface to detect memory leaks.

From now on Team NewPipe try to ensure to only introduce new stable features to the normal application.
